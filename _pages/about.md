Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I completed my MS in Computer Science at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), where my thesisâ€”advised by [Prof. Koustuv Saha](https://koustuv.com/)â€”focused on developing a human-in-the-loop framework for stereotype detection in Text-to-Image models, using LLMs as social bias judges. I was awarded the prestigious J N Tata Scholarship in recognition of academic excellence and societal impact.

 In summer 2024, I interned at [Dragonfruit AI](https://www.dragonfruit.ai/), building surveillance software for retail security. Previously, I was an ML Scientist at [Onward Assist](https://onwardassist.ai/), where I developed AI tools for pathologists. I also contributed to real-time mixed reality guidance systems for medical instrument tracking at UIUCâ€™s [Healthcare Engineering Systems Centre](https://hes-center.ahs.illinois.edu/).

I completed my undergraduate studies at Manipal Institute of Technology, where I collaborated with [UNSW Sydney](https://www.unsw.edu.au/) on coral reef analysis. 

**Areas of focus:** Machine Learning, Software Engineering, Computer Vision, LLMs, Systems 

**Grateful to my mentors:**
