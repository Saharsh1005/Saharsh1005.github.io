I'm dedicated to leveraging technology for societal impact. Under the guidance of Prof. Koustuv Saha, my research focuses on Large Language Models for social computing and content moderation, enhancing digital platform safety and inclusivity. This summer, I am interning at [Dragonfruit AI](https://www.dragonfruit.ai/), developing surveillance software for retail security.

Previously, I worked as an ML Scientist at [Onward Assist](https://onwardassist.ai/), creating AI tools for pathologists that improved pathological analysis, demonstrating AI's practical healthcare benefits. My research at UIUC's Healthcare Engineering Systems Centre provided real-time mixed reality guidance for medical instrument tracking.

During my undergraduate studies at Manipal Institute of Technology, I collaborated with UNSW Sydney on reef analysis, underscoring my commitment to environmental conservation. As a J N Tata Scholarship recipient, I exemplify academic excellence and future impact.

Areas of Expertise: Computer Vision, 3D Vision, Full Stack Software Engineering, Cloud (AWS).

I am deeply grateful to my mentors: [Prof. Saha](https://koustuv.com/), [Prof. Hoiem](https://dhoiem.cs.illinois.edu/), [Prof. Forsyth](http://luthuli.cs.uiuc.edu/~daf/), [Prof. Chandra](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-rohitash-chandra), [Prof. Kamath](https://www.manipal.edu/mit/department-faculty/faculty-list/radhika-kamath.html), [Prof. Avinash Gupta](https://hfaging.ahs.illinois.edu/avinash-gupta/), [Harris Nissar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harris-nisar-1b090415a), [Yuqun Wu](https://yuqunw.github.io/), Mustaffa Hussain.

Let's code for good!
