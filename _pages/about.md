I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, with a focus on computer vision and software engineering. Previously, I held the position of ML Scientist at [Onward Assist](https://onwardassist.ai/), India, where I specialized in developing pathological analytical tools for slide diagnosis.

I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal, in 2022. During my time at Manipal, I collaborated with [Professor Chandra](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-rohitash-chandra) at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, ‘Transitional-AI’ center. Our work involved generating detailed coral reef maps from remote sensing data and conducting a qualitative comparison of clustering techniques.

I am passionate about leveraging AI to bring societal impact. Let’s code for good!
