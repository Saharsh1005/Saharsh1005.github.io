Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I completed my MS in CS at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/ms-program), advised by [Prof. Koustuv Saha](https://koustuv.com/) and was awarded J N Tata Scholarship. My thesis focused on developing a human-in-the-loop framework for stereotype detection in Text-to-Image models, using LLMs as social bias judges.

**Industry Experience** I work as a SWE at [Dragonfruit AI](https://www.dragonfruit.ai/), building surveillance software for retail security. Previously, I was an ML Scientist at [Onward Assist](https://onwardassist.ai/), where I developed AI tools for pathology.

I hold a B.Tech in Computer Science from Manipal Institute of Technology.

**Areas of focus:** Machine Learning, Software Engineering, Computer Vision, LLMs, Systems

**Grateful to my mentors:**
[Prof. Koustuv Saha](https://koustuv.com/), [Prof. Prerna Juneja](https://prernajuneja.com/), [Prof. Derek Hoiem](https://dhoiem.cs.illinois.edu/), [Prof. David Forsyth](http://luthuli.cs.uiuc.edu/~daf/), [Prof. Rohitash Chandra](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-rohitash-chandra), [Prof. Radhika Kamath](https://www.manipal.edu/mit/department-faculty/faculty-list/radhika-kamath.html), [Prof. Avinash Gupta](https://hfaging.ahs.illinois.edu/avinash-gupta/), [Harris Nissar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harris-nisar-1b090415a), [Yuqun Wu](https://yuqunw.github.io/)
